# BatteryTest
A super simple python script to test the duration of my laptop's battery

# How it works
 - Run the program in console (Not Shell)
 - When you turn your computer back on, read `Battery Life.txt`
 - `2:10:15` = 2 Hours, 10 Minutes, 15 Seconds

# Setup
To enable writing to a file, ensure `SAVETOFILE = True`
